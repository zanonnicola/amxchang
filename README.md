I'm a high school student who lives in the United States. I'm learning how to code. I love making and designing webpages with HTML and CSS (and possible JavaScript in the future).  It's fun to code something that anyone on the web can easily see. I also enjoy programming in C++ and Python because they challenge me more. I love it when I can finally solve a difficult problem.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, Python, and C++.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating webpages and learning how to progam.
- ðŸ˜€ I like to crochet, code, read, and draw in my free time.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about fountain pens.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My first line of code was not "Hello World!"
