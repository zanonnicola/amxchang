I'm a high school student who's learning how to code.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, Python, and C++.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [my website](https://amxchang.github.io/) and learning how to code.
- ðŸ˜€ I like to crochet, code, read, and draw in my free time.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about fountain pens.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My first line of code was not "Hello World!"
